# Introduction to the DA_NLP_CV project 
This project has three components, Data Analysis, NLP, and Computer Vision.

## The goals of each component of the project
<b>Component1 - Data Analysis: </b>
1. cleans the unstructured data `booksummaries.txt`.
2. converts it to a structured one.
3. saves the cleaned form of data in a CSV file `cleaned_df.csv`.

<b>Component2 - NLP: </b>
1. shortens preprocessed summaries. 
2. saves the shortened summaries in a CSV file `shortened_summaries.csv`.

<b>Component3 - Computer Vision: </b>
1. generates images from scratch based on the shortened summaries.
2. saves them in the `/generated_images` directory located in the `root` directory.
   
## Usage
### Component1 - Data Analysis
You can go through the notebook `Component1_Data_Analysis.ipynb` with prepared datasets located in the `/component1_data_analysis/datasets` directory to create the `cleaned_df.csv` file, or you can utilize the file `cleaned_df.csv` located in the `root` directory if you want to save time.

### Component2 - NLP
You can walk through `Component2_NLP.ipynb` to shorten summaries and create the `shortened_summaries.csv` file, or you can utilize the file `shortened_summaries.csv` located in the `root` directory if you want to save time.

### Component3 - Computer Vision
You can follow up the notebook `Component3_Computer_Vision.ipynb` to generate images from scratch based on the shortened summaries, or you can navigate to the 
`/generated_images` directory located in the `root` directory to see generated images.
